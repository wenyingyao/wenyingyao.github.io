                <h3>Forecasting the volatility of asset returns: The informational gain from option prices (with Vance Martin and 
                        Chrismin Tang), <i>International Journal of Forecasting, forthcoming</i>.</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207020301539">Published version</a></p>
                    <p>Abstract: A new class of forecasting models is proposed that extends the Realized GARCH class of models through 
                        the inclusion of option prices to forecast the variance of asset returns. The VIX is used to approximate option 
                        prices resulting in a set of cross-equation restrictions on the model's parameters. The full model is characterized 
                        by a nonlinear system of three equations containing asset returns, the realized variance and the VIX, with estimation
                        of the parameters based on maximum likelihood methods. The forecasting properties of the new class of forecasting
                        models, as well as a number of special cases, are investigated and applied to forecasting the daily S&P500 index 
                        realized variance using intra-day and daily data from September 2001 to November 2017. The forecasting results 
                        provide strong support for including the realized variance and the VIX to improve variance forecasts, with linear 
                        conditional variance models performing well for short-term 1-day ahead forecasts, whereas log-linear conditional 
                        variance models tend to perform better for intermediate 5-day ahead forecasts.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: This paper develops a methodology for detecting and measuring contagion using high frequency data 
                        which disentangles continuous and discontinuous price movements. We demonstrate its finite sample properties 
                        using Monte-Carlo simulation, focusing on the empirically plausible parameter space. Decisions to extend the 
                        role of financial regulation around the world to the supervision of insurers post-GFC has been met with 
                        literature which supports both the systemic importance of insurers and contrasting evidence that insurers are 
                        rather the 'victims' of shocks transmitted via banks. We contribute to this debate by considering the 
                        time-varying evidence for contagion at both the firm level and the sectorial level impacts. A number of 
                        insurance companies exhibits bank-like characteristics. Our evidence for contagion effects from banks to the 
                        real economy, with similar impact from the insurers, supports the view that financial regulation on banks 
                        does need to be extended to the insurance sector.

                    Economic Record, 2020</i>.</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-4932.12565">Published version</a></p>
                    <p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish empirical evidence for the relationship between the systematic jump betas 
                        of financial institutions and two types of systemic risk indices: a capital shortfall index and a 
                        interconnectedness index. Using high-frequency data for US financial sector stocks, we show that equity market 
                        jumps are related positively to capital shortfall and negatively to interconnectedness. Higher potential capital
                        shortfall measures of systemic risk lead to a greater sensitivity to systematic jumps, while increased 
                        interconnectedness leads to greater resistance. Our findings, along with indicators such as size and leverage, 
                        provide a means to identify the possible trade-offs that regulators might face when assessing the systemic risks 
                        of financial institutions, particularly in the context of the cross-multiple influences within the sector. </p>

                    <p>Abstract: We propose a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) estimator of a predictive 
                        regression in which stock returns are conditioned on a large set of lagged covariates, some of which are 
                        highly persistent and potentially cointegrated. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed LASSO 
                        estimator and validate our theoretical findings using simulation studies. The application of this proposed 
                        LASSO approach to forecasting stock returns suggests that a cointegrating relationship among the persistent 
                        predictors leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of stock returns over various competing 
                        forecasting methods with respect to mean squared error.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: We evaluate the impact of extreme market shifts on equity portfolios and study the difference in 
                        negative and positive reactions to market jumps with implications for portfolio risk management. Employing 
                        high-frequency data for the constituents of the S&P500 index over the period 2 January 2003 to 30 December 
                        2017, we investigate to what extent the portfolio exposure to the downside and upside jumps can be mitigated. 
                        We contrast the risk exposure of individual stocks with those of the portfolios as the number of holdings 
                        increases. Varying the jump identification threshold, we show that the number of holdings required to stabilise 
                        portfolios’ sensitivities to negative jumps is higher than when positive jumps are considered and that the 
                        asymmetry is more prominent for more extreme events. Ignoring this asymmetry results in under-diversification 
                        of portfolios and increases exposure to sudden extreme negative market shifts.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: Using intraday data to construct realized variance estimates combined with daily data on equity returns
                        from January 1996 to May 2017, equity markets in East Asia are found to be relatively more risky than other 
                        markets. The framework uses an intertemporal capital asset pricing model with conditional moments based on 
                        realized volatility and a GARCH-in-mean specification to study the impact of news. Significant non-linear 
                        dynamics are also identified, with a positive relationship between expected returns and news associated with 
                        small shocks, and a negative relationship for large shocks. A similar relationship is found for the Australian 
                        market, but not for the US and UK equity markets.</p>
                    
                <h3>High frequency characterization of Indian banking stocks (with Mohammad Sayeed and Mardi Dungey), <i>Journal of 
                    Emerging Markets Finance, 2018</i>.</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0972652718777081">Published version</a></p>
                    <p>Abstract: Using high-frequency stock returns in the Indian banking sector, we find that the beta on jump 
                        movements substantially exceeds that on the continuous component, and that the majority of the information 
                        content for returns lies with the jump beta. We contribute to the debate on strategies to decrease systemic 
                        risk, showing that increased bank capital and reduced leverage reduce both jump and continuous beta with 
                        slightly stronger effects for capital on continuous beta and stronger effects for leverage on jump beta. 
                        However, changes in these firm characteristics need to be large to create an economically meaningful change in 
                        beta.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07350015.2015.1077139">Published version</a></p>
                    <p>Abstract: In this article, we investigate the theoretical behavior of finite lag VAR(n) models fitted to time 
                        series that in truth come from an infinite-order VAR(∞) data-generating mechanism. We show that the overall 
                        error can be broken down into two basic components, an estimation error that stems from the difference between 
                        the parameter estimates and their population ensemble VAR(n) counterparts, and an approximation error that 
                        stems from the difference between the VAR(n) and the true VAR(∞). The two sources of error are shown to be 
                        present in other performance indicators previously employed in the literature to characterize, so-called, 
                        truncation effects. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the magnitude of the estimation error exceeds that 
                        of the approximation error, but experimental results based upon a prototypical real business cycle model and a 
                        practical example indicate that the approximation error approaches its asymptotic position far more slowly than
                        does the estimation error, their relative orders of magnitude notwithstanding. The experimental results suggest
                        that with sample sizes and lag lengths like those commonly employed in practice VAR(n) models are likely to
                        exhibit serious errors of both types when attempting to replicate the dynamics of the true underlying process
                        and that inferences based on VAR(n) models can be very untrustworthy.</p>
                    
                <h3>On weak identification in structural VAR(MA) models (with Timothy Kam and Farshid Vahid), <i> Economics Letters
                    (lead article)</i>, 2017.</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176517301374">Published version</a></p>
                    <p>Abstract: We simulate synthetic data from known data generating processes (DGPs) that arise from economic theory,
                        and compare the performance of fitted VAR and VARMA models in estimating the true impulse responses to
                        structural shocks. We show that while the VARMA structures implied by these DGPs are theoretically identified
                        and lead to precise estimates of impulse responses given enough data, their parameters are close to the
                        non-identified ridge in the parameter space, and that makes precise estimation of the impulse responses in small
                        samples typical of macroeconomic data improbable. As a result, VARMA models barely show any advantage over VARs
                        in characterizing the known DGPs in small samples. This is a refinement of the conjecture that near
                        non-stationarity, near non-invertibility or weak identification could be possible reasons for the failure of
                        structural VARMA models in providing good estimates of theoretical impulse responses of particular DSGE
                        models.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: Using high frequency data we decompose the time-varying beta for stocks into beta for continuous 
                        systematic risk and beta for discontinuous systematic risk. Estimated discontinuous betas for S & P500 
                        constituents over 2003-2011 generally exceed the corresponding continuous betas. Smaller stocks are more 
                        sensitive to discontinuities than their larger counterparts, and during periods of financial distress, high 
                        leverage stocks are more exposed to systematic risk. Higher credit ratings and lower volatility are each 
                        associated with smaller betas. Industry effects are also apparent. We use the estimates to show that 
                        discontinuous risk carries a significantly positive premium, but continuous risk does not.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: This article studies a simple, coherent approach for identifying and estimating error-correcting vector
                        autoregressive moving average (EC-VARMA) models. Canonical correlation analysis is implemented for both 
                        determining the cointegrating rank, using a strongly consistent method, and identifying the short-run VARMA 
                        dynamics, using the scalar component methodology. Finite-sample performance is evaluated via Monte Carlo 
                        simulations and the approach is applied to modelling and forecasting US interest rates. The results reveal that 
                        EC-VARMA models generate significantly more accurate out-of-sample forecasts than vector error correction 
                        models (VECMs), especially for short horizons.</p>

                        index, we assess the speed of convergence of continuous and discontinuous betas in portfolios of stocks as the
