                    and the <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au">University of Tasmania</a> since I obtained my PhD degree from the 
                    <a href="https://www.monash.edu › business › ebs">Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics</a>, Monash University in December 2013.</p>
                    
                <p>My research covers time series econometrics in general, with a particular focus on the applications of innovative econometric and statistical tools
                    to macroeconomic and financial market data. I have worked on a wide range of research projects in high frequency financial econometrics, multivariate
                    time series modelling, empirical finance, macro-econometrics, macro-financial linkages, and interdisciplinary projects on forecasting. My research 
                    has been published in top field journals in econometrics, including Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, Journal of 
                    Applied Econometrics, among other outlets.</p>

                        volatility connectedness network of equity markets during crises</a> (with Tingting Cheng, Fei Liu and Junli Liu), 
                        <i>Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, 2024</i>.</h3>

                    <p>Abstract: This paper studies the global volatility connectedness network among 16 stock markets under different 
                        market conditions. We construct measures of tail connectedness following Ando et al. (2022) by introducing 
                        quantile regression into the classic Diebold–Yilmaz network model. We demonstrate the advantages of using tail 
                        connectedness for measuring extreme systemic risk, and examine the dynamic evolution of volatility connectedness 
                        from 2005 to 2021 at different quantiles. Our empirical results suggest that when the market is calm, the 
                        strength of volatility connectedness is determined by the closeness of economic and trade ties. Although (North) 
                        American and European stock markets tend to act as net risk providers during crises, Asian markets have become 
                        increasingly influential in the past two decades. We also find that the spillover of extreme risks is 
                        predominantly unidirectional, with either the U.S. or China sitting at the center of the spillover network 
                        and transmitting risks to the regional centers and peripheral markets.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: This paper studies high-frequency econometric methods to test for a jump in the <i>spread</i> of
                        bond yields. We propose a coherent inference procedure that detects a jump in the yield spread only if at 
                        least one of the two underlying bonds displays a jump. Ignoring this inherent connection by basing inference 
                        only on a univariate jump test applied to the spread tends to overestimate the number of jumps in yield spreads
                        and puts the coherence of test results at risk. We formalize the statistical approach in the context of an 
                        intersection union test in multiple testing. We document the relevance of coherent tests and their 
                        practicability via simulations and real data examples.</p>

                    <i>Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics, 2024</i>.</h3>

                    <p>Abstract: Changes in the distribution of income over time are identified based on an adjusted two-sample 
                        version of the Neyman smooth test developed in Bera, Ghosh and Xiao (2013) by using subsampling methods to  
                        approximate the sampling distribution of the test statistic when samples are not independent of each other. 
                        A range of Monte Carlo experiments show that the approach corrects for size distortions arising from dependent 
                        samples as well as generating monotonic power functions. Applying the approach to studying the distribution of 
                        income in Australia over the business cycle and the Global Financial Crisis, the empirical results highlight the 
                        importance of higher-order moments and demonstrate that business cycles are not all alike as the relative strengths 
                        of higher-order moments vary over phases of the cycle.</p>

                    <i>Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics & Econometrics, 2022</i>.</h3>

                    <p>Abstract: This paper investigates how different commodity prices are affected by unconventional monetary 
                        policies (UMP) implemented by the Federal Reserve of the United States as a response to the Global Financial 
                        Crisis. We analyze impulse responses using local projections and identify UMP shocks through high-frequency 
                        identification strategy. We show that forward guidance (FG) and large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) shocks lead
                        to distinct responses when analyzing commodity prices. We find that asset-like commodities, such as gold and
                        silver, respond to these UMP shocks most aggressively. While an easing FG shock leads to increases in their 
                        prices, an easing LSAP shock has the opposite effect. This differential response suggests that these asset-like
                        commodities are being used as inflation and exchange rate hedges. In contrast, production-like and agricultural
                        commodities respond to UMP shocks in the same way as conventional monetary policy shocks. Consistent with previous
                        literature, we find that easing LSAP shocks, to some extent, signal a negative economic outlook. Policymakers can
                        exploit the responses from the various commodity classes examined in this paper when evaluating the effectiveness
                        of monetary policy in different sectors of the economy.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of herding behaviour in the Chinese mutual fund market from a 
                        time-varying perspective. We examine the relationship between the dispersion of fund returns and the fund market 
                        returns using a Markov regime switching approach, and explore the driving factors of herding under different 
                        regimes. Our results suggest that herding behaviour is time-varying and heterogeneous across different fund types, 
                        investment styles, fund sizes, and industrial groups. In addition, the observed herding behaviours are mainly driven
                        by non-fundamentals. We also find that herding behaviour is more pronounced during the up market and becomes 
                        insignificant during the down market.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: Recent advances in high frequency financial econometrics enable us to characterize which components of 
                        the data generating processes change in crisis, and which do not. This paper introduces a new statistic which 
                        captures large discontinuities in the composition of a given price series. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that 
                        this statistic is useful in characterizing the tail behaviour across different sample periods. An application to 
                        US Treasury market provides evidence consistent with identifying periods of stress via flight-to-cash behaviour 
                        which results in increased abrupt price falls at the short end of the term structure, and decreased negative price 
                        jumps at the long end.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: This paper investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the connectedness network of stock market 
                        volatility in 19 economies around the world. Our method builds on the Diebold-Yilmaz volatility network model 
                        to construct the volatility spillover index, and uses lag sparse group LASSO to accommodate the high-dimensional 
                        system. We find that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic strengthens the overall volatility connectedness, and 
                        the global connectedness level remains high throughout 2020. In particular, connections across different continents 
                        have become stronger during this period. However, China is shown to be disconnected from the global volatility 
                        connectedness network until late November 2020. We find evidence that China is not the main source of volatility 
                        spillover during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: A new class of forecasting models is proposed that extends the Realized GARCH class of models through 
                        the inclusion of option prices to forecast the variance of asset returns. The VIX is used to approximate option 
                        prices resulting in a set of cross-equation restrictions on the model's parameters. The full model is characterized 
                        by a nonlinear system of three equations containing asset returns, the realized variance and the VIX, with estimation
                        of the parameters based on maximum likelihood methods. The forecasting properties of the new class of forecasting
                        models, as well as a number of special cases, are investigated and applied to forecasting the daily S&P500 index

                    <p>Abstract: This paper develops a methodology for detecting and measuring contagion using high frequency data 
                        which disentangles continuous and discontinuous price movements. We demonstrate its finite sample properties 
                        using Monte-Carlo simulation, focusing on the empirically plausible parameter space. Decisions to extend the 
                        role of financial regulation around the world to the supervision of insurers post-GFC has been met with 
                        literature which supports both the systemic importance of insurers and contrasting evidence that insurers are 
                        rather the 'victims' of shocks transmitted via banks. We contribute to this debate by considering the 
                        time-varying evidence for contagion at both the firm level and the sectorial level impacts. A number of 
                        insurance companies exhibits bank-like characteristics. Our evidence for contagion effects from banks to the 
                        real economy, with similar impact from the insurers, supports the view that financial regulation on banks 
                        does need to be extended to the insurance sector.

                    <p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish empirical evidence for the relationship between the systematic jump betas 
                        of financial institutions and two types of systemic risk indices: a capital shortfall index and a 
                        interconnectedness index. Using high-frequency data for US financial sector stocks, we show that equity market 
                        jumps are related positively to capital shortfall and negatively to interconnectedness. Higher potential capital
                        shortfall measures of systemic risk lead to a greater sensitivity to systematic jumps, while increased 
                        interconnectedness leads to greater resistance. Our findings, along with indicators such as size and leverage, 
                        provide a means to identify the possible trade-offs that regulators might face when assessing the systemic risks 
                        of financial institutions, particularly in the context of the cross-multiple influences within the sector. </p>

                        high-frequency data for the constituents of the S&P500 index over the period 2 January 2003 to 30 December 
                        2017, we investigate to what extent the portfolio exposure to the downside and upside jumps can be mitigated. 
                        We contrast the risk exposure of individual stocks with those of the portfolios as the number of holdings 
                        increases. Varying the jump identification threshold, we show that the number of holdings required to stabilise

                    <p>Abstract: Using high-frequency stock returns in the Indian banking sector, we find that the beta on jump 
                        movements substantially exceeds that on the continuous component, and that the majority of the information 
                        content for returns lies with the jump beta. We contribute to the debate on strategies to decrease systemic 
                        risk, showing that increased bank capital and reduced leverage reduce both jump and continuous beta with 
                        slightly stronger effects for capital on continuous beta and stronger effects for leverage on jump beta.

                        series that in truth come from an infinite-order VAR(∞) data-generating mechanism. We show that the overall 
                        error can be broken down into two basic components, an estimation error that stems from the difference between 
                        the parameter estimates and their population ensemble VAR(n) counterparts, and an approximation error that 
                        stems from the difference between the VAR(n) and the true VAR(∞). The two sources of error are shown to be 
                        present in other performance indicators previously employed in the literature to characterize, so-called, 
                        truncation effects. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the magnitude of the estimation error exceeds that 
                        of the approximation error, but experimental results based upon a prototypical real business cycle model and a 
                        practical example indicate that the approximation error approaches its asymptotic position far more slowly than
                        does the estimation error, their relative orders of magnitude notwithstanding. The experimental results suggest
                        that with sample sizes and lag lengths like those commonly employed in practice VAR(n) models are likely to
                        exhibit serious errors of both types when attempting to replicate the dynamics of the true underlying process
                        and that inferences based on VAR(n) models can be very untrustworthy.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: We simulate synthetic data from known data generating processes (DGPs) that arise from economic theory,

                        structural shocks. We show that while the VARMA structures implied by these DGPs are theoretically identified
                        and lead to precise estimates of impulse responses given enough data, their parameters are close to the
                        non-identified ridge in the parameter space, and that makes precise estimation of the impulse responses in small
                        samples typical of macroeconomic data improbable. As a result, VARMA models barely show any advantage over VARs
                        in characterizing the known DGPs in small samples. This is a refinement of the conjecture that near
                        non-stationarity, near non-invertibility or weak identification could be possible reasons for the failure of
                        structural VARMA models in providing good estimates of theoretical impulse responses of particular DSGE
